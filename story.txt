Chris Godwin is a receiver for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He's playing a game
of football in New England, but his quarterback Tom Brady seems to have
forgotten he exists and will only throw to Mike Evans. On an unrelated note,
Chris Godwin is on cook29@wisc.edu's fantasy football team.

Think on the bright side.  At least you weren't one of those schmucks who
drafted TLaw early thinking that he would magically make the Jags a better
 team.  20 game loss steak fml.  One day we won't be an embarressment to the
state.
